#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Good to know! The Emacs manual also has a chapter on "accumulating text". Excerpt:

- ‘M-x append-to-buffer’ :: Append region to the contents of a specified buffer.
-  ‘M-x prepend-to-buffer’ :: Prepend region to the contents of a specified buffer.
-  ‘M-x copy-to-buffer’ :: Copy region into a specified buffer, deleting that buffer’s old contents.
-  ‘M-x insert-buffer’ :: Insert the contents of a specified buffer into current buffer at point.
-  ‘M-x append-to-file’ :: Append region to the contents of a specified file, at the end.
